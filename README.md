# Pension Calculator App

## Project Overview
This Pension Calculator App is a  tool designed to perform calculations for both Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) pension schemes. It demonstrates proficiency in pension calculations, understanding of UK pension legislation, and software development skills crucial for this role.

## Key Features
- DB pension calculations including:
  - Basic pension calculation based on salary and service
  - Early/late retirement adjustments
  - Commutation calculations
- DC pension projections
- Lifetime Allowance (LTA) checks
- Annual Allowance (AA) calculations
- State Pension Age determination
- Multiple scheme handling via SQLite database integration
- User-friendly graphical interface

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- SQL database management (SQLite) and SQL queries
- GUI development with PyQt5
- Version control with Git
- Software testing and error handling

## Pension Knowledge Showcased
- Understanding of DB and DC scheme structures
- Implementation of key UK pension legislation, including:
  - Lifetime Allowance rules
  - Annual Allowance calculations
  - Normal Minimum Pension Age considerations
- Familiarity with early/late retirement factors
- Commutation calculations
- State Pension Age rules

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system
2. Install required packages: `pip install PyQt5`
3. Run `init_db.py` to set up the database with sample schemes
4. Execute `main.py` to launch the application



With this application, I hope to have showcased my ability to combine technical skills with pension knowledge, making me well-suited for the Pension Calculation Analyst position that requires both calculation expertise and software development capabilities.
